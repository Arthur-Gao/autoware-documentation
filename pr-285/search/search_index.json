This trade-off problem can be solved technically by introducing real-time capability. This is because autonomous driving systems are not really designed to be real-fast, that is, low-latency computing is nice-to-have but not must-have. The must-have feature for autonomous driving systems is that the latency of computing is predictable, that is, the systems are real-time.

However, since a MMS requires high-end sensors for precise positioning, its operational cost can be very expensive and may not be suitable for a relatively small driving environment. Alternatively, a Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) algorithm can be used to create a point cloud map from recorded LiDAR scans.</p> <p>Commonly used open-source SLAM implementations are lidarslam-ros2 (LiDAR, IMU*) and LIO-SAM (LiDAR, IMU, GNSS). The required sensor data for each algorithm is specified in the parentheses, where an asterisk (*) indicates that such sensor data is optional. For supported LiDAR models, please check the Github repository of each algorithm.

Most of these algorithms already have a built-in loop-closure and pose graph optimization. However, if the built-in, automatic loop-closure fails or does not work correctly, you can use Interactive SLAM to adjust and optimize a pose graph manually.</p> <p>Since Autoware is based on ROS 2, it could be problematic if you want to install ROS 1-based SLAM implementations on the same machine. To avoid this problem, you can use Docker or simply install them on a different machine. Another problem is the ROSBAG version; these SLAM implementations require ROSBAG 1 instead of ROSBAG 2 used by Autoware. For the ROSBAG version problem, you may use this stand-alone converter to convert a ROSBAG 2 file to a ROSBAG 1 file and vice versa.</p> <p>If you prefer proprietary software that is easy to use, you can try a fully automatic mapping tool from MAP IV, Inc., MapIV Engine.
