Autoware concepts Contributing to open source projects How can I get help? How can I contribute? Participate in discussions Join a working group Report bugs Make a pull request Like Autoware itself, these guidelines are being actively developed and suggestions for improvement are always welcome! Guideline changes can be proposed by creating a discussion in the Ideas category . Code of Conduct # To ensure the Autoware community stays open and inclusive, please follow the code of conduct . If you believe that someone in the community has violated the code of conduct, please make a report by emailing conduct@autoware.org. What should I know before I get started? # Autoware concepts # To gain a high-level understanding of Autoware's architecture and design, the following pages provide a brief overview: Autoware architecture Autoware concepts For experienced developers, the Autoware interfaces and individual component pages should also be reviewed to understand the inputs and outputs for each component or module at a more detailed level. Contributing to open source projects # If you are new to open source projects, we recommend reading GitHub's How to Contribute to Open Source guide for an overview of why people contribute to open source projects, what it means to contribute and much more besides. How can I get help? # Do not open issues for general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for confirmed bug reports. Instead, open a discussion in the Q&A category. For more details on the support mechanisms for Autoware, refer to the Support guidelines . Note Issues created for questions or unconfirmed bugs will be moved to GitHub discussions by the maintainers. How can I contribute? # Discussions # You can contribute to Autoware by facilitating and participating in discussions, such as: Proposing a new feature to enhance Autoware Joining an existing discussion and expressing your opinion Organizing discussions for other contributors Answering questions and supporting other contributors Working groups # The various working groups within the Autoware Foundation are responsible for accomplishing goals set by the Technical Steering Committee. These working groups are open to everyone, and joining a particular working group will allow you to gain an understanding of current projects, see how those projects are managed within each group and to contribute to issues that will help progress a particular project. To see the schedule for upcoming working group meetings, refer to the Autoware Foundation events calendar . Bug reports # Before you report a bug, please search the issue tracker for the appropriate repository. It is possible that someone has already reported the same issue and that workarounds exist. If you can't determine the appropriate repository, ask the maintainers for help by creating a new discussion in the Q&A category . When reporting a bug, you should provide a minimal set of instructions to reproduce the issue. Doing so allows us to quickly confirm and focus on the right problem. If you want to fix the bug by yourself that will be appreciated, but you should discuss possible approaches with the maintainers in the issue before submitting a pull request. Creating an issue is straightforward , but if you happen to experience any problems then create a Q&A discussion to ask for help. Pull requests # You can submit pull requests for small changes such as: Minor documentation updates Fixing spelling mistakes Fixing CI failures Fixing warnings detected by compilers or analysis tools Making small changes to a single package If your pull request is a large change, discuss with the maintainers before submission. Doing so ensures that the proposed change is in line with Autoware's design philosophy and current development plans. If you're not sure where to have that conversation, then create a new Q&A discussion . Examples of large changes include: Adding a new feature to Autoware Adding a new documentation page or section For more information on how to submit a good pull request, have a read of the pull request guidelines and don't forget to review the required license notations !","title":"Contributing"},{"location":"contributing/#contributing","text":"Thank you for your interest in contributing!

For the detailed explanation of the model, refer to GitHub Docs . The following is a general example of the pull request workflow. Create a fork. (for the first time only) Create an issue. Discuss the approach to the issue with maintainers. Write code in the agreed approach. Write the tests and documentation if necessary. Follow the guidelines when you write code, tests, and documentation. Coding guidelines Testing guidelines Documentation guidelines Follow the Commit guidelines when commit your change. Test the code. In the later review process, you will need to write what tests you have done. Create a pull request. Read the pull request template carefully and fill the required content. Assign reviewers after creating a pull request. If you have no rights to assign reviewers, just mention them instead. If you are not sure who to set reviewers, contact to the people written as the maintainer tag in package.xml . Wait for the pull request to be reviewed. The reviewers will review your code following the review guidelines . Take a look at the guidelines as well because it is good to understand the thoughts of the reviewer's side. If CI checks have failed, fix the errors. Address the review comments pointed out by the reviewers. If you cannot understand or agree with a review comment, discuss it with the reviewers and find a rational reason. The author should be responsible for the final content of their pull request. The reviewers are obligated to make the author understand the meanings of each comment. After you have done with them, re-request a review to the reviewers and back to 6. If there are no more new review comments, the reviewers will approve the pull request and go to 6. Merge the pull request. Confirm all items of the checklist are checked off before merging. Anyone with write access can merge the pull request if there is no special request from maintainers. Generally, the author is expected to merge it to feel responsible for their pull request. If the author does not have write access, ask the reviewers or maintainers. It is the author's responsibility to care about their own pull request until it is merged. CI checks # Autoware has several checks for a pull request. The results are shown at the bottom of the pull request page as below. If the \u274c mark is shown, click the Details button and investigate the failure reason. If the Required mark is shown, you cannot merge the pull request unless you resolve the error. If not, it is optional, but preferably it should be fixed. The following sections explain about common CI checks in Autoware. Note that some repositories may have different settings. DCO # The Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) is a lightweight way for contributors to certify that they wrote or otherwise have the right to submit the code they are contributing to the project. This workflow checks whether the pull request fulfills DCO . You need to confirm the required items and commit with git commit -s . For more information, refer to the GitHub App page . semantic-pull-request # Autoware uses Conventional Commits with the settings of commitizen/conventional-commit-types . This workflow checks whether the pull request follows Conventional Commits . Note that if there is only one commit in the pull request, you need to make the commit title semantic as well. This is due to GitHub's non-intuitive behavior when there is only one commit. GitHub uses the commit title for the squashed commit message, instead of the pull request title. For more detailed behaviors of this workflow, refer to amannn/action-semantic-pull-request . For the detailed rules, see the commit guidelines . pre-commit # pre-commit is a tool to run formatters or linters when you commit.

For the detailed explanation of the model, refer to GitHub Docs . The following is a general example of the pull request workflow. Create a fork. (for the first time only) Create an issue. Discuss the approach to the issue with maintainers. Write code in the agreed approach. Write the tests and documentation if necessary. Follow the guidelines when you write code, tests, and documentation. Coding guidelines Testing guidelines Documentation guidelines Follow the Commit guidelines when commit your change. Test the code. In the later review process, you will need to write what tests you have done. Create a pull request. Read the pull request template carefully and fill the required content. Assign reviewers after creating a pull request. If you have no rights to assign reviewers, just mention them instead. If you are not sure who to set reviewers, contact to the people written as the maintainer tag in package.xml . Wait for the pull request to be reviewed. The reviewers will review your code following the review guidelines . Take a look at the guidelines as well because it is good to understand the thoughts of the reviewer's side. If CI checks have failed, fix the errors. Address the review comments pointed out by the reviewers. If you cannot understand or agree with a review comment, discuss it with the reviewers and find a rational reason. The author should be responsible for the final content of their pull request. The reviewers are obligated to make the author understand the meanings of each comment. After you have done with them, re-request a review to the reviewers and back to 6. If there are no more new review comments, the reviewers will approve the pull request and go to 6. Merge the pull request. Confirm all items of the checklist are checked off before merging. Anyone with write access can merge the pull request if there is no special request from maintainers. Generally, the author is expected to merge it to feel responsible for their pull request.

Value of integration testing # Integration tests determine if independently developed software modules work correctly when the modules are connected to each other. In ROS 2, the software modules are called nodes. Testing a single node is a special type of integration test that is commonly referred to as component testing. Integration tests help to find the following types of errors: Incompatible interactions between nodes, such as non-matching topics, different message types, or incompatible QoS settings. Edge cases that were not touched by unit testing, such as a critical timing issue, network communication delays, disk I/O failures, and other such problems that can occur in production environments. Issues that can occur while the system is under high CPU/memory load, such as malloc failures. This can be tested using tools like stress and udpreplay to test the performance of nodes with real data. With ROS 2, it is possible to program complex autonomous-driving applications with a large number of nodes. Therefore, a lot of effort has been made to provide an integration-test framework that helps developers test the interaction of ROS 2 nodes. Integration-test framework # A typical integration-test framework has three parts: A series of executables with arguments that work together and generate outputs. A series of expected outputs that should match the output of the executables. A launcher that starts the tests, compares the outputs to the expected outputs, and determines if the test passes. In Autoware, we use the launch_testing framework. Smoke tests # Autoware has a dedicated API for smoke testing. To use this framework, in package.xml add: <test_depend> autoware_testing </test_depend> And in CMakeLists.txt add: if ( BUILD_TESTING ) find_package ( autoware_testing REQUIRED ) add_smoke_test ( ${ PROJECT_NAME } ${ NODE_NAME } ) endif () Doing so adds smoke tests that ensure that a node can be: Launched with a default parameter file. Terminated with a standard SIGTERM signal. For the full API documentation, refer to the package design page . Note This API is not suitable for all smoke test cases. It cannot be used when a specific file location (eg: for a map) is required to be passed to the node, or if some preparation needs to be conducted before node launch. In such cases use the manual solution from the component test section below . Integration test with a single node: component test # The simplest scenario is a single node. In this case, the integration test is commonly referred to as a component test. To add a component test to an existing node, you can follow the example of the lanelet2_map_loader in the map_loader package (added in this PR ). In package.xml , add: <test_depend> ros_testing </test_depend> In CMakeLists.txt , add or modify the BUILD_TESTING section: if ( BUILD_TESTING ) add_ros_test ( test/lanelet2_map_loader_launch.test.py TIMEOUT \"30\" ) install ( DIRECTORY test/data/ DESTINATION share/ ${ PROJECT_NAME } /test/data/ ) endif () In addition to the command add_ros_test , we also install any data that is required by the test using the install command. Note The TIMEOUT argument is given in seconds; see the add_ros_test.cmake file for details. The add_ros_test command will run the test in a unique ROS_DOMAIN_ID which avoids interference between tests running in parallel. To create a test, either read the launch_testing quick-start example , or follow the steps below. Taking test/lanelet2_map_loader_launch.test.py as an example, first dependencies are imported: import os import unittest from ament_index_python import get_package_share_directory import launch from launch import LaunchDescription from launch_ros.actions import Node import launch_testing import pytest Then a launch description is created to launch the node under test. Note that the test_map.osm file path is found and passed to the node, something that cannot be done with the smoke testing API : @pytest . mark . launch_test def generate_test_description (): lanelet2_map_path = os . path . join ( get_package_share_directory ( \"map_loader\" ), \"test/data/test_map.osm\" ) lanelet2_map_loader = Node ( package = \"map_loader\" , executable = \"lanelet2_map_loader\" , parameters = [{ \"lanelet2_map_path\" : lanelet2_map_path }], ) context = {} return ( LaunchDescription ( [ lanelet2_map_loader , # Start test after 1s - gives time for the map_loader to finish initialization launch . actions . TimerAction ( period = 1.0 , actions = [ launch_testing . actions . ReadyToTest ()] ), ] ), context , ) Note Since the node need time to process the input lanelet2 map, we use a TimerAction to delay the start of the test by 1s. In the example above, the context is empty but it can be used to pass objects to the test cases. You can find an example of using the context in the ROS 2 context_launch_test.py test example. Finally, a test is executed after the node executable has been shut down ( post_shutdown_test ). Here we ensure that the node was launched without error and exited cleanly. @launch_testing . post_shutdown_test () class TestProcessOutput ( unittest . TestCase ): def test_exit_code ( self , proc_info ): # Check that process exits with code 0: no error launch_testing . asserts . assertExitCodes ( proc_info ) Running the test # Continuing the example from above, first build your package: colcon build --packages-up-to map_loader source install/setup.bash Then either execute the component test manually: ros2 test src/universe/autoware.universe/map/map_loader/test/lanelet2_map_loader_launch.test.py Or as part of testing the entire package: colcon test --packages-select map_loader Verify that the test is executed; e.g. $ colcon test-result --all --verbose ... build/map_loader/test_results/map_loader/test_lanelet2_map_loader_launch.test.py.xunit.xml: 1 test, 0 errors, 0 failures, 0 skipped Next steps # The simple test described in Integration test with a single node: component test can be extended in numerous directions, such as testing a node's output. Testing the output of a node # To test while the node is running, create an active test by adding a subclass of Python's unittest.TestCase to *launch.test.py . Some boilerplate code is required to access output by creating a node and a subscription to a particular topic, e.g. import unittest class TestRunningDataPublisher ( unittest . TestCase ): @classmethod def setUpClass ( cls ): cls . context = Context () rclpy . init ( context = cls . context ) cls . node = rclpy . create_node ( \"test_node\" , context = cls . context ) @classmethod def tearDownClass ( cls ): rclpy . shutdown ( context = cls . context ) def setUp ( self ): self . msgs = [] sub = self . node . create_subscription ( msg_type = my_msg_type , topic = \"/info_test\" , callback = self . _msg_received ) self . addCleanup ( self . node . destroy_subscription , sub ) def _msg_received ( self , msg ): # Callback for ROS 2 subscriber used in the test self . msgs . append ( msg ) def get_message ( self ): startlen = len ( self . msgs ) executor = rclpy . executors .

Taking test/lanelet2_map_loader_launch.test.py as an example, first dependencies are imported: import os import unittest from ament_index_python import get_package_share_directory import launch from launch import LaunchDescription from launch_ros.actions import Node import launch_testing import pytest Then a launch description is created to launch the node under test. Note that the test_map.osm file path is found and passed to the node, something that cannot be done with the smoke testing API : @pytest . mark . launch_test def generate_test_description (): lanelet2_map_path = os . path . join ( get_package_share_directory ( \"map_loader\" ), \"test/data/test_map.osm\" ) lanelet2_map_loader = Node ( package = \"map_loader\" , executable = \"lanelet2_map_loader\" , parameters = [{ \"lanelet2_map_path\" : lanelet2_map_path }], ) context = {} return ( LaunchDescription ( [ lanelet2_map_loader , # Start test after 1s - gives time for the map_loader to finish initialization launch . actions . TimerAction ( period = 1.0 , actions = [ launch_testing . actions . ReadyToTest ()] ), ] ), context , ) Note Since the node need time to process the input lanelet2 map, we use a TimerAction to delay the start of the test by 1s. In the example above, the context is empty but it can be used to pass objects to the test cases. You can find an example of using the context in the ROS 2 context_launch_test.py test example. Finally, a test is executed after the node executable has been shut down ( post_shutdown_test ). Here we ensure that the node was launched without error and exited cleanly. @launch_testing . post_shutdown_test () class TestProcessOutput ( unittest .

It uses all the results from Localization, Perception, and Map stacks to decide its maneuver and gives final trajectory to Control stack. Role # These are high-level roles of Planning stack: Calculates route that navigates to desired goal Plans trajectory to follow the route Make sure that vehicle does not collide with obstacles, including pedestrians and other vehicles Make sure that the vehicle follows traffic rules during the navigation. This includes following traffic light, stopping at stoplines, stopping at crosswalks, etc. Plan sequences of trajectories that is feasible for the vehicle. (e.g. no sharp turns that is kinematically impossible) Input # The table below summarizes the overall input into Planning stack: Input Topic Name(Data Type) Explanation Vehicle Pose /tf (map->base_link) ( tf::tfMessage ) Planning requires vehicle pose in map frame, which is the frame where all planning takes place. Vehicle Kinematics /localization/kinematic_state ( nav_msgs/msg/Odometry ) This includes vehicle's pose and velocity information. It is used to predict future pose on trajectory to detect collision with other objects. Map data /map/vector_map ( autoware_auto_mapping_msgs/msg/HADMapBin ) This includes all static information about the environment, such as: Lane connection information used for route planning from starting position to goal position Lane geometry to generate reference path used to calculate trajectory All information related to traffic rules Detected Object Information /perception/object_recognition/objects ( autoware_auto_perception_msgs/msg/PredictedObjects ) This includes information that cannot be known beforehand such as pedestrians and other vehicles. Planning stack will plan maneuvers to avoid collision with such objects. Detected Obstacle Information /perception/obstacle_segmentation/pointcloud ( sensor_msgs/msg/PointCloud2 ) This includes information on the location of obstacles. This is more primitive information and is used for emergency stops, etc. Occupancy Map Information /perception/occupancy_grid_map/map ( nav_msgs/msg/OccupancyGrid ) This includes information that cannot be known beforehand such as pedestrians and other vehicles. Planning stack will plan maneuvers to avoid collision with such objects.

The first one is Autoware AD API for operating the vehicle from outside the autonomous driving system such as the Fleet Management System (FMS) and Human Machine Interface (HMI) for operators or passengers. The second one is Autoware component interface for components to communicate with each other. The last one is the local interface used inside the component. Concept # Applications can operate multiple and various vehicles in a common way. Applications are not affected by version updates and implementation changes. Developers only need to know the interface to add new features and hardware. Requirements # Goals: AD API provides functionality to create the following applications: Drive the vehicle on the route or drive to the requested positions in order. Operate vehicle behavior such as starting and stopping. Display or announce the vehicle status to operators, passengers, and people around. Control vehicle devices such as doors. Monitor the vehicle or drive it manually. AD API provides stable and long-term specifications. This enables unified access to all vehicles. AD API hides differences in version and implementation and absorbs the impact of changes. AD API has a default implementation and can be applied to some simple ODDs with options. The AD API implementation is extensible with the third-party components as long as it meets the specifications. The component interface provides stable and medium-term specifications. This makes it easier to add components. The component interface clarifies the public and private parts of a component and improves maintainability. The component interface is extensible with the third-party design to improve the sub-components' reusability. Non-goals: AD API does not cover security. Use it with other reliable methods. The component interface is just a specification, it does not include an implementation. Architecture # The components of Autoware are connected via the component interface. Each component uses the interface to provide functionality and to access other components. AD API implementation is also a component. Since the functional elements required for AD API are defined as the component interface, other components do not need to consider AD API directly. Tools for evaluation and debugging, such as simulators, access both AD API and the component interface. The component interface has a hierarchical specification. The top-level architecture consists of some components. Each component has some options of the next-level architecture. Developers select one of them when implementing the component. The simplest next-level architecture is monolithic. This is an all-in-one and black box implementation, and is suitable for small group development, prototyping, and very complex functions. Others are arbitrary architecture consists of sub-components and have advantages for large group development. A sub-component can be combined with others that adopt the same architecture. Third parties can define and publish their own architecture and interface for open source development. It is desirable to propose them for standardization if they are sufficiently evaluated. Features # Communication Method # As shown in the table below, interfaces are classified into four communication methods to define their behavior. Function Call is a request-response communication and is used for processing that requires immediate results. The others are publish-subscribe communication. Notification is used to process data that changes with some event, typically a callback. Streams handle continuously changing data. Reliable Stream expects all data to arrive without loss, Realtime Stream expects the latest data to arrive with low delay. Communication Method ROS Implementation Optional Implementation Function Call Service HTTP Notification Topic (reliable, transient_local) MQTT (QoS=2, retain) Reliable Stream Topic (reliable, volatile) MQTT (QoS=2) Realtime Stream Topic (best_effort, volatile) MQTT (QoS=0) These methods are provided as services or topics of ROS since Autoware is developed using ROS and mainly communicates with its packages. On the other hand, FMS and HMI are often implemented without ROS, Autoware is also expected to communicate with applications that do not use ROS. It is wasteful for each of these applications to have an adapter for Autoware, and a more suitable means of communication is required. HTTP and MQTT are suggested as additional options because these protocols are widely used and can substitute the behavior of services and topics. In that case, text formats such as JSON where field names are repeated in an array of objects, are inefficient and it is necessary to consider the serialization. Naming Convention # The name of the interface must be /<component name>/api/<interface name> , where <component name> is the name of the component. For an AD API component, omit this part and start with /api . The <interface name> is an arbitrary string separated by slashes. Note that this rule causes a restriction that the namespace api must not be used as a name other than AD API and the component interface. The following are examples of correct interface names for AD API and the component interface: /api/autoware/state /api/autoware/engage /planning/api/route/set /vehicle/api/status The following are examples of incorrect interface names for AD API and the component interface: /ad_api/autoware/state /autoware/engage /planning/route/set/api /vehicle/my_api/status Logging # It is recommended to log the interface for analysis of vehicle behavior. If logging is needed, rosbag is available for topics, and use logger in rclcpp or rclpy for services. Typically, create a wrapper for service and client classes that logs when a service is called. Restrictions # For each API, consider the restrictions such as following and describe them if necessary. Services: response time pre-condition post-condition execution order concurrent execution Topics: recommended delay range maximum delay recommended frequency range minimum frequency default frequency Data Structure # Data Type Definition # Do not share the types in AD API unless they are obviously the same to avoid changes in one API affecting another. Also, implementation-dependent types, including the component interface, should not be used in AD API for the same reason. Use the type in AD API in implementation, or create the same type and copy the data to convert the type. Constants and Enumeration # Since ROS don't support enumeration, use constants instead. The default value of type such as zero and empty string should not be used to detect that a variable is unassigned. Alternatively, assign it a dedicated name to indicate that it is undefined. If one type has multiple enumerations, comment on the correspondence between constants and variables. Assign unique values to all constants so that it can be distinguished from other enumerations. Do not use enumeration values directly, as assignments are subject to change when the version is updated. Time Stamp # Clarify what the timestamp indicates. for example, send time, measurement time, update time, etc. Consider having multiple timestamps if necessary. Use std_msgs/msg/Header when using ROS transform. Also consider whether the header is common to all data, independent for each data, or additional timestamp is required. Request Header # Currently, there is no required header. Response Status # The interfaces whose communication method is Function Call use a common response status to unify the error format. For those interfaces, include the ResponseStatus shown below in the response with the name status. The data status.summary.code is the execution result of the interface, and the caller branches the process according to this value. Others are for the users and should not be used directly by the program. These data are primarily used to provide users with solution tips and to ask the developer for the cause of the error. The typical use of the field details is when an interface calls other interfaces. That interface stores response statuses in details , then merges them and sets the result to summary . This allows the developer to know which component was causing the error by checking details . ResponseStatus Name Type Description summary ResponseStatusDetail status summary details ResponseStatusDetail Array status details ResponseStatusDetail Name Type Description code uint32 response status code component string the component that caused the error message string error message description string error information such as detailed message and document URL ResponseStatusCode Group Code Description 0x0000 0x0000 UNKNOWN T.B.D.

Unknown versions are also treated as available as long as the major versions match (excluding major version 0). Compatibility between AD API and the component interface is assumed to be maintained by the version management system. If an unintended behavior of AD API is detected, the application should take appropriate action. Autoware tries to keep working as long as possible, but it is not guaranteed to be safe. Safety should be considered for the entire system, including the applications.","title":"Autoware Interface Design"},{"location":"design/autoware-interfaces/#autoware-interface-design","text":"","title":"Autoware Interface Design"},{"location":"design/autoware-interfaces/#abstract","text":"Autoware defines three categories of interfaces.

Monitor the vehicle or drive it manually. AD API provides stable and long-term specifications. This enables unified access to all vehicles. AD API hides differences in version and implementation and absorbs the impact of changes. AD API has a default implementation and can be applied to some simple ODDs with options. The AD API implementation is extensible with the third-party components as long as it meets the specifications. The component interface provides stable and medium-term specifications. This makes it easier to add components. The component interface clarifies the public and private parts of a component and improves maintainability. The component interface is extensible with the third-party design to improve the sub-components' reusability. Non-goals: AD API does not cover security. Use it with other reliable methods. The component interface is just a specification, it does not include an implementation.","title":"Requirements"},{"location":"design/autoware-interfaces/#architecture","text":"The components of Autoware are connected via the component interface. Each component uses the interface to provide functionality and to access other components. AD API implementation is also a component. Since the functional elements required for AD API are defined as the component interface, other components do not need to consider AD API directly. Tools for evaluation and debugging, such as simulators, access both AD API and the component interface. The component interface has a hierarchical specification. The top-level architecture consists of some components. Each component has some options of the next-level architecture. Developers select one of them when implementing the component. The simplest next-level architecture is monolithic. This is an all-in-one and black box implementation, and is suitable for small group development, prototyping, and very complex functions. Others are arbitrary architecture consists of sub-components and have advantages for large group development. A sub-component can be combined with others that adopt the same architecture. Third parties can define and publish their own architecture and interface for open source development. It is desirable to propose them for standardization if they are sufficiently evaluated.","title":"Architecture"},{"location":"design/autoware-interfaces/#features","text":"","title":"Features"},{"location":"design/autoware-interfaces/#communication-method","text":"As shown in the table below, interfaces are classified into four communication methods to define their behavior. Function Call is a request-response communication and is used for processing that requires immediate results. The others are publish-subscribe communication. Notification is used to process data that changes with some event, typically a callback. Streams handle continuously changing data. Reliable Stream expects all data to arrive without loss, Realtime Stream expects the latest data to arrive with low delay. Communication Method ROS Implementation Optional Implementation Function Call Service HTTP Notification Topic (reliable, transient_local) MQTT (QoS=2, retain) Reliable Stream Topic (reliable, volatile) MQTT (QoS=2) Realtime Stream Topic (best_effort, volatile) MQTT (QoS=0) These methods are provided as services or topics of ROS since Autoware is developed using ROS and mainly communicates with its packages. On the other hand, FMS and HMI are often implemented without ROS, Autoware is also expected to communicate with applications that do not use ROS. It is wasteful for each of these applications to have an adapter for Autoware, and a more suitable means of communication is required. HTTP and MQTT are suggested as additional options because these protocols are widely used and can substitute the behavior of services and topics.

Introduction # Currently, Autoware assumes that vehicles use an Ackermann kinematic model with Ackermann steering. Thus, Autoware adopts the Ackermann command format for the Control module's output (see the AckermannDrive ROS message definition for an overview of Ackermann commands, and the AckermannControlCommands struct used in Autoware for more details). However, it is possible to integrate Autoware with a vehicle that follows a differential drive kinematic model, as commonly used by small mobile robots. 2. Procedure # One simple way of using Autoware with a differential drive vehicle is to create a vehicle_interface package that translates Ackermann commands to differential drive commands. Here are two points that you need to consider: Create vehicle_interface package for differential drive vehicle Set an appropriate wheel_base 2.1 Create a vehicle_interface package for differential drive vehicle # An Ackermann command in Autoware consists of two main control inputs: steering angle ( \\omega \\omega ) velocity ( v v ) Conversely, a typical differential drive command consists of the following inputs: left wheel velocity ( v_l v_l ) right wheel velocity ( v_r v_r ) So, one way in which an Ackermann command can be converted to a differential drive command is by using the following equations: v_l = v - \\frac{l\\omega}{2}, v_r = v + \\frac{l\\omega}{2} v_l = v - \\frac{l\\omega}{2}, v_r = v + \\frac{l\\omega}{2} where l l denotes wheel tread. For information about other factors that need to be considered when creating a vehicle_interface package, refer to the vehicle_interface component page . 2.2 Set an appropriate wheel_base # A differential drive robot does not necessarily have front and rear wheels, which means that the wheelbase (the horizontal distance between the axles of the front and rear wheels) cannot be defined. However, Autoware expects wheel_base to be set in vehicle_info.param.yaml with some value. Thus, you need to set a pseudo value for wheel_base . The appropriate pseudo value for wheel_base depends on the size of your vehicle. Setting it to be the same value as wheel_tread is one possible choice. Warning If the wheel_base value is set too small then the vehicle may behave unexpectedly. For example, the vehicle may drive beyond the bounds of a calculated path. Conversely, if wheel_base is set too large, the vehicle's range of motion will be restricted. The reason being that Autoware's Planning module will calculate an overly conservative trajectory based on the assumed vehicle length. 3. Known issues # Motion model incompatibility # Since Autoware assumes that vehicles use a steering system, it is not possible to take advantage of the flexibility of a differential drive system's motion model. For example, when planning a parking maneuver with the freespace_planner module, Autoware may drive the differential drive vehicle forward and backward, even if the vehicle can be parked with a simpler trajectory that uses pure rotational movement.","title":"How to integrate Autoware with a differential drive vehicle"},{"location":"tutorials/advanced/how-to-integrate-autoware-with-a-diff-drive-vehicle/#how-to-integrate-autoware-with-a-differential-drive-vehicle","text":"","title":"How to integrate Autoware with a differential drive vehicle"},{"location":"tutorials/advanced/how-to-integrate-autoware-with-a-diff-drive-vehicle/#1-introduction","text":"Currently, Autoware assumes that vehicles use an Ackermann kinematic model with Ackermann steering.
