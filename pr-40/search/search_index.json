Simulation methods # Ad hoc simulation # Ad hoc simulation is a simulation method that you run simulations flexibly on your local machine. It is recommended for your first trial. Scenario simulation # Scenario simulation is a simulation method that a scenario runner runs simulations based on scenarios you defined. It is often run automatically on a CI system, but you can also run this simulation on your local machine. Simulation types # Autoware supports three types of simulations. Note that it is just a rough classification, and that there are several minor derivative versions. Planning simulation # Planning simulation is a simulation type that uses simple dummy data and tests mainly planning/control components. Rosbag replay simulation # Rosbag replay simulation is a simulation type that uses Rosbag data and tests mainly perception modules.
